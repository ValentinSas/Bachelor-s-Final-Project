# Three-Finger Articulated Robotic Gripper — BSc Project



A fully 3D-printed **three-finger articulated robotic gripper**, designed to achieve stable grasping through tendon-driven actuation, elastic return mechanisms, and servo-controlled motion. Developed using low-cost components, custom CAD modeling, and an Arduino-based control system.

## Features & Architecture

### **Finger Kinematics**
- Three articulated fingers, each with **3 phalanges + base joint**  
- Anthropomorphic geometry (scaled human-hand proportions)  
- CAD-designed links, pulleys, springs, and support structure  

### **Actuation System**
- **4 servomotors** controlling finger flexion + rotating “thumb”  
- Tendon-driven pull mechanism with elastic return  
- Optimized for spherical and cylindrical object gripping  

### **Electronics & Control**
- **Arduino Uno** with PWM-based servo control  
- 17 predefined serial commands for combined/individual motion  
- Modular assembly for quick adjustments and maintenance

## Summary

This project shows how an accessible, low-cost design can deliver reliable multi-finger grasping using tendon routing, servo actuation, and articulated 3D-printed mechanics.  
Future improvements: stronger servos, refined tendon tensioning, and an onboard interface (LCD/OLED) for standalone operation.
